# Notion. Recruitment Test
## Frontend React Developer

### Requirements

- Installed NodeJS (> v10.0) with NPM or Yarn
- Git
- A cup of :coffee: or :tea:

### Tasks

We'd like you to use React, SCSS and bootstrap. On top of that, use whatever front-end libraries you feel comfortable with.

#### Setup
1. Fork or duplicate this repo
2. Run `npm install` and `npm start`
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

#### Backlog

_All items are **not** ordered and weighted! First, before coding, read all items carefully and weight those._

##### Customer voices during kickoff

- We need a small webpage - just with a few nice cars.
- A tool your company used to work with tool can export a JSON file with all cars we offer.
- Our customers should pick one of our rental cars.
- But only marked cars are allowed to be rent.
- During holidays we will offer some very big discounts every year.
- We need a smooth nice animation for the menu.
- Right now we donÂ´t need a reservation function. Prospective customers have to call your office.


We've provided a design (please refer `./media-package`) for hd screens (1920px). Don't worry about tackling smaller breakpoints, but please make sure your solution looks good at 375px in portrait orientation.
